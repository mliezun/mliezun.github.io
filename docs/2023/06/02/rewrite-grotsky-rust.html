was done in Go. The goal of the rewrite is to improve my Rust skills, and to improve the performance of Grotsky,
by at least 10x.</p><p>As of this writting the Rust implementation is 4x faster than the Golang implementation.</p><p>I've rewritten the Lexer, Parser and part of the Runtime. Enough for run this code and measure
		how long it takes for each implementation to finish:</p><p><pre class="triple-quote js language-css">let a = 1
while a < 100000000 {
    a = a + 1
}
</pre></p><p>I was inspired by Mitchel Hashimoto's post: 
<a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects" target="_blank">My Approach to Building Large Technical Projects</a>. And I want to create a roadmap of little projects to reach my goal of having a full-fledged interpreter in Rust.
</p><h3>Goal</h3><p>Until now Grotsky has been running on a Tree-based interpreter. My goal is that at the end of the rewrite I
			will have a Bytecode interpreter.
</p><p>First I want to rewrite the Tree-based interpreter in Rust and achieve at least 10x performance improvement.
</p><p>Then figure out if I want to use a Register based or Stack based bytecode interpreter.
</p><p>Also, I would like to have a stable bytecode representation to be able to compile programs to a binary format
 that can be shipped as is or packaged into a binary.
</p><p>Finally, it's time Grotsky gets a REPL.
</p><h3>Roadmap</h3><p>Believe it or not, Grotsky it's pretty big. It has support for reading and writting files, sockets and more
 on the stdlib. Which means I have a huge task ahead of me.
</p><p>First thing I want to do is to have some sort of automated testing setup that can compare Rust vs Go implementation.
 Right now all test are written as Go unit test, I need to make them agnostic of language backend.
</p><p><ul><li><strong>Jun 9:</strong> Have a complete setup of automated tests for correctness and performance.</li><li><strong>Jun 16:</strong> Language runtime (without stdlib) rewritten in Rust.</li><li><strong>Jun 23:</strong> Finish migrating stdlib and publish results (new blog post). Use new implementation for blog engine.</li><li><strong>Jun 30:</strong> Decide which kind of bytecode interpreter to use, then make a design and plan for the implementation.</li><li><strong>Jul 7:</strong> Have a working bytecode interpreter that is able to run the program shown in this post ^. Just a simple while loop. Compare performance and share progress.</li><li><strong>Jul 14:</strong> Add support for functions and closures.</li><li><strong>Jul 21:</strong> Finish runtime without stdlib in bytecode interpreter.</li><li><strong>Jul 28:</strong> Implement stdlib in bytecode interpreter. Share results.</li><li><strong>Aug 5:</strong> Add ability to compile to bytecode and run from bytecode.</li><li><strong>Aug 12:</strong> Add REPL and finish up project.</li></ul></p><p>Im gonna have lots of fun with this project and Im sure next time a post here I'll be a changed man.
 Surely gonna learn a lot, Im excited about what lies ahead.
