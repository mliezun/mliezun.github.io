was done in Go. The goal of the rewrite is to improve my Rust skills, and to improve the performance of Grotsky,
by at least 10x. This has been a serious of posts, this one is the latest one. Hopefully the best and most insightful
of them all.</p><p>In previous posts:
<ul><li><a href="https://mliezun.com/2023/06/02/rewrite-grotsky-rust.html">Rewrite my toy language interpreter in Rust
</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://mliezun.com/2023/09/23/grotsky-rust-part2.html">Rewrite my toy language interpreter in Rust, an update
</a></li></ul> I've outlined a plan to migrate Grotsky to a Rust based platform.
</p><p>
			Originally, my plan was very ambitious and I thought I would be able to finish the transition
			in like two months.
			In reality it took five months :-)
			
</p><h3>Performance improvement</h3><p>I was aiming at a 10x improvement. In reality is not that much.
 I ran various benchmarks and get at most a 4x improvement.
 Which is not great, but also not that bad given that I know very little
 of how to do high performance Rust.
 The interpreter is written in the most dumbest and easiest way I managed to do it.
</p><p>Let's look at some numbers for different programs.
</p><h4>Loop program</h4><p><pre class="triple-quote js language-css">let start = io.clock()
fn test() {
    let a = 1
    while a < 10000000 {
        a = a + 1
    }
}
test()
io.println(io.clock() - start)
</pre></p><p>The result is:
<pre class="triple-quote js language-css">trial #1
build/grotsky   best 5.135s  3.877x time of best
build/grotsky-rs   best 1.325s  287.6800% faster
trial #2
build/grotsky   best 5.052s  3.814x time of best
build/grotsky-rs   best 1.325s  281.4182% faster
trial #3
build/grotsky   best 5.035s  3.802x time of best
build/grotsky-rs   best 1.325s  280.1663% faster
trial #4
build/grotsky   best 5.003s  3.777x time of best
build/grotsky-rs   best 1.325s  277.6831% faster
trial #5
build/grotsky   best 5.003s  3.777x time of best
build/grotsky-rs   best 1.325s  277.6831% faster
</pre></p><h4>Recursive fibonacci</h4><p><pre class="triple-quote js language-css">let start = io.clock()
fn fib(n) {
	if n <= 2 {
		return n
	}
	return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
}
fib(28)
io.println(io.clock() - start)
</pre></p><p>The result is:
<pre class="triple-quote js language-css">trial #1
build/grotsky   best 0.8409s  294.5155% faster
build/grotsky-rs   best 3.317s  3.945x time of best
trial #2
build/grotsky   best 0.8168s  271.3829% faster
build/grotsky-rs   best 3.033s  3.714x time of best
trial #3
build/grotsky   best 0.797s  245.6835% faster
build/grotsky-rs   best 2.755s  3.457x time of best
trial #4
build/grotsky   best 0.7784s  249.9964% faster
build/grotsky-rs   best 2.724s  3.5x time of best
trial #5
build/grotsky   best 0.7784s  249.9964% faster
build/grotsky-rs   best 2.724s  3.5x time of best
</pre></p><p>In this case is like 3.5x slower. This is due to function calls.
 Im not very well versed in Rust, so on each call im copying a lot of
 data over and over. In the go implementation everything is just pointers
 so there's less copying.
</p><h3>Compile to bytecode</h3><p>With the Rust implementation, generating and compiling to bytecode was added.
 Now it's possible to generate a bytecode file to later read it.
 This is a way of distributing files without giving away source code and also 
 a little bit more performant because you skip parsing and compilation phases.
</p><p>How it works:
<pre class="triple-quote bash language-css">grotsky compile example.gr  # Compile file
grotsky example.grc  # Run compiled file
</pre></p><h3>Memory model</h3><p>Grotsky is a reference-counted language. We're using Rust's Rc and RefCell to keep track of values.
</p><p><pre class="triple-quote rust language-rust">pub struct MutValue&lt;T&gt;(pub Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;);

impl&lt;T&gt; MutValue&lt;T&gt; {
    pub fn new(obj: T) -&gt; Self {
        MutValue::&lt;T&gt;(Rc::new(RefCell::new(obj)))
    }
}

pub enum Value {
    Class(MutValue&lt;ClassValue&gt;),
    Object(MutValue&lt;ObjectValue&gt;),
    Dict(MutValue&lt;DictValue&gt;),
    List(MutValue&lt;ListValue&gt;),
    Fn(MutValue&lt;FnValue&gt;),
    Native(NativeValue),
    Number(NumberValue),
    String(StringValue),
    Bytes(BytesValue),
    Bool(BoolValue),
    Slice(SliceValue),
    Nil,
}

pub enum Record {
    Val(Value),
    Ref(MutValue&lt;Value&gt;),
}

pub struct VM {
    pub activation_records: Vec&lt;Record&gt;,
}
</pre></p><p>Most of the simple values are just stored as-is: Native (builtin functions), Number, String,
 Bytes, Bool, Slice and Nil.
</p><p>For the other complex values we need to use 'pointers' which in this case are MutValue.
</p><p>Then the Grotsky VM uses Records which can be a plain Value or a reference to a Value.
 The records are registers, each function has up to 255 registers.
 The reference to values are used to store upvalues.
 A register is turned into an upvalue when a variable is closed by another function.
</p><p>This implementation ends up being very slow, but easy to manage. Because Rust stdlib
 does all the work.
</p><h3>Using Rust in this blogpost</h3><p>As you may know, this <a href='https://mliezun.com/2021/10/04/new-blog-engine.html' target='_blank'>blog is powered by grotsky</a>.
 Im happy to say that I successfully migrated from grotsky to grostky-rs as the backend for the blog.
 And what you're reading now is generated by the latest implementation of the language using Rust.
</p><p>Even for local development the Rust version is used. Which means Im using a TCP server and an HTTP
 implementation written in Grotsky.
</p><h3>Closing remarks</h3><p>This has been a great learning, Im happy to have finished because it required a lot of effort.
 Im not gonna announce any new work on this interpreter but I would like to keep adding stuff.
 Improving it further to make it more performant and more usable.
</p><p>In the end I encourage everyone to try it and also start their own project. Is always cool to see
 what everyone else is doing.
</p><p>Thanks for reading.
