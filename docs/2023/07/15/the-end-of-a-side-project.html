			but it was a fun project to work on, learn some new stuff and collab with a friend.
			There are some takeaways from this that I'd like to share.
</p><h3>Building something simple is hard</h3><p>From the beginning we were trying to build a simple product to get notified when new versions
			of Python were supported in AWS Lambda. But we figured we could support other things too, like
			all Lambda runtimes, then also GCP and Azure, then more services of each one.
Features started piling up pretty quickly.
</p><p>When building stuff I try to think of every edge case, even the most improbable ones, and make
			the software infalible. Of course, it's impossible to succeed at that, software will always be fallible.
And this premature optimization ends up making the project more complex than it should be.
</p><p>We planned to work on this for a 1 or 2 months, and it ended up taking 6+ months :-).
</p><p>My takeaway here is: start building the dumbest thing possible that gets the job done, then adjust as needed.
</p><h3>Getting users is hard</h3><p>We're killing this project because nobody uses it.
And nobody except us has used it since it was launched more than a year ago.
Some people subscribed but never even opened an email.
</p><p>We tried to advertise in our social media and post it in different builders communities.
But that will get you so far if you're not an influencer that has the right audience.
</p><p>We thought that we'll get more traffic from organic search or people telling their friends about this.
But in the end I think nobody really needed something like this that much.
</p><p>My takeaway here is: building something that people really want and getting the product to the hands
			of the people that want it is very complicated. You should think very deeply about what problem your
			product is solving and how your users will find you.
</p><h3>The money</h3><p>This has costed like $200 (US dollars) since inception. For two people that's like $100 each.
It's not a lot, but for something that has no users that's quite expensive.
</p><p>We used Lambdas to serve this project.
I feel like we were promised that the cloud and serverless are cheap and easy solution.
But in my opinion it doesn't seem to be the case.
It's definitely not easier nor cheaper than having a PHP website in this case.
Im sure there are other cases in which it makes more sense.
</p><p>This is also a reason of why we're killing the project.
Our service started failing because after a deploy dependencies were updated and the code
			was to big to fit on a Lambda.
It would have been a lot of work to fix it, so we decided to kill it and save some bucks every month.
</p><p>For personal projects which you're not sure how they're going to scale,
			I think serverless is probably not the right choice.
Serverless make sense if you're going to have huge burst of traffics and don't want
			to handle a lot of infra.
</p><p>My takeaway here is: beware of the cloud, if you're just building a small side project
			or don't have huge infra needs stick with the cheapest providers (Hostinger, PythonAnywhere, Hetzner)
			and avoid cloud providers (GCP, Azure, AWS).
</p><h3>Final thougths</h3><p>If I haven't made this clear enough, building a successful product is *hard*.
There are many things to think about when starting, and the technical stuff hopefully
			is the easy part.
I think this are the 3 most important lessons that I've learned working on this:
<ul><li>Build the dumbest thing that does the job, improve as needed.</li><li>Think deeply about what problem are you solving and how you're going to deliver the solution to the people that need it.</li><li>Beware of the cloud, if possible use a cheaper provider. It will save you money and headaches.</li></ul></p></article><footer><hr/><div class="footer-wrapper"><div><div>This blog was made with
