building a programming language called 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mliezun/grotsky">Grotksy</a>. Just a toy programming language that I made based on the book 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>, which I totally recommend buying and reading if you haven't yet.
</p><p>I wanted to build something interesting but simple enough that could be made with Grotsky.
I tought that replacing Jekyll with my own engine was a task worth a try.
There is nothing groundbreaking or innovative being made here, just a little experimentation.
</p><p>I have to give credit to the project 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fpereiro/lith">lith</a>, because the 'templating' engine for the blog is inspired by it.
</p></div><h3>How did I do it?</h3><div><p>That's a good question.</p><p>Originally, this blog was powered by Jekyll, that translated markdown to html and hosted
 by Github Pages. I decided that I was going to build a templating engine and generate html
 to keep things simple.
</p><p>But also, as a challenge I made a simple HTTP server to use as a dev server when trying the blog locally.
</p></div><h3>HTTP Server</h3><div><p>For the purpose of having a custom HTTP Server I had to add support for TCP sockets to the language.
I wrapped the go standard library in some functions and exposed that to the Grotsky language.
In grotsky looks something like this
</p><pre class="triple-quote go">
let socket = net.listenTcp(host + ":" + port)
let conn
while true {
	try {
		conn = socket.accept()
	} catch err {
		io.println("Error accepting new connection", err)
		continue
	}
	try {
		# Call function that handles connection
		handleConn(conn)
	} catch err {
		io.println("Error handling connection", err)
	}
	try {
		conn.close()
	} catch err {}
}
				
</pre><p>This means that the server listens on a socket, accepts connections, writes some text/bytes to the connection
 and then closes the connection.
</p></div><h3>Template Engine</h3><div><p>The templating engine is built using the native support Grotsky provide for lists.
A regular page for the blog looks like this:
</p><pre class="triple-quote go">
let base = import("../base.gr")
# Create new Post Object
let post = base.Post(
	"Title",
	"Brief description of blog post.",
	"Author Name",
	"descriptive,tags",
	[
		[
			"h2",
			[],
			[
				"Title"
			]
		],
		[
			"div",
			["class", "content"],
			[
				"Content line 1",
				"Content line 2",
			]
		]
	]
)
			</pre><p>It's pretty straightforward: the first element of the list is the html tag, the second is
an array of properties for the tag and the last one is a list that contains what will be
the *content* of enclosed by the tags.
