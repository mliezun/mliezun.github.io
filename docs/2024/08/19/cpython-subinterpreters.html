</h2><p>
</p><p>Lately, I've been working with Python C-API. I wanted to use subinterpreters with their own GIL to unlock the performance gains promised by being able to execute many threads in parallel which was not possible before Python 3.12.
</p><p>The reason is that I've been building a Caddy web server plugin called: <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/mliezun/caddy-snake'>Caddy Snake</a>.
</p><p>The plugin let's users embed a Python interpreter and serve requests directly from <a target='_blank' href='https://caddyserver.com'>Caddy</a>.
</p><p>Caddy is written in Go, and to interact with Python I had to use CGO, a compatibility layer that makes it easy to call C functions from Go.
</p><p>To improve performance I wanted to use the new feature of having separate GIL per subinterpreter so requests could be served by many threads at the same time.
</p><p>Today I saw a <a target='_blank' href='https://izzys.casa/2024/08/463-python-interpreters/'>great blogpost</a> about finding a bug in subinterpreters and that inspired me to write about my experience.
</p><p>
</p><h2>The issue
</h2><p>
</p><p>I started <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/mliezun/caddy-snake/pull/9/files'>coding up</a> a basic implementation to see if I could serve simple requests from subinterpreters.
</p><p>From the get go I found that requests were failing in Python version 3.12 but working for previous versions thanks to CI tests.
</p><p>The failure was constrained to a C function where the HTTP status code was being converted from string to int: <span class='single-quote'>strtol(statusCode)</span>.
</p><p>By printing the content of the <span class='single-quote'>statusCode</span> variable I found the following difference.
</p><p>In main interpreter:
</p><pre class="triple-quote ">200
</pre><p>
</p><p>In a subinterpreter:
</p><pre class="triple-quote text">&lt;HttpStatusCode.OK: 200&gt;
</pre><p>
</p><p>I managed to track down the enum that was causing this. Then I crafted some code to try to reproduce the error in a standard Python interpreter.
</p><p>I came up with this:
</p><pre class="triple-quote python">import _xxsubinterpreters as interpreters


script = """from enum import _simple_enum, IntEnum

@_simple_enum(IntEnum)
class MyEnum:
    DATA = 1
    
print(str(MyEnum.DATA))
"""

exec(script)
# Output: 1

interp_id = interpreters.create(isolated=False)
interpreters.run_string(interp_id, script)
# Output: &lt;MyEnum.DATA: 1&gt;, Expected: 1
</pre><p>
</p><p>That piece of code executes the same python code in both the main interpreter and a freshly created subinterpreter. The output should be the same, but it's not. The problem was independent of running with a separate GIL or with the same GIL.
</p><p>Checking the <span class='single-quote'>__str__</span> methods I could see that they were clearly different.
</p><p>In main interpreter:
</p><pre class="triple-quote python">...
print(MyEnum.DATA.__str__)
# Output: &lt;method-wrapper '__repr__' of MyEnum object at 0x7f9a09a2e910&gt;
</pre><p>
</p><p>In subinterpreter:
</p><pre class="triple-quote python">...
print(MyEnum.DATA.__str__)
# Output: &lt;method-wrapper '__str__' of MyEnum object at 0x7f9a099a5e90&gt;
</pre><p>
</p><p>In the main interpreter the method wraps <span class='single-quote'>__repr__</span>.
In the subinterpreter it wraps <span class='single-quote'>__str__</span>.
</p><p>At this point I couldn't believe what I was looking at. When your program has a bug you always assume is your fault, it's rare to see the case where the problem is in the INTERPRETER.
</p><p>But to my own disbelief I had found a problem with the CPython implementation.
</p><h2>Doing my homework
</h2><p>
</p><p>After that I decided that I was gonna do the right thing: file an issue in Github telling what I just witnessed.
</p><p>First thing first: read the guide on <a target='_blank' href='https://devguide.python.org/#contributing'>how to contribute to python</a>.
</p><p>This is what you should always do when contributing to a project because you might find that your problem is actually not worth reporting or that it was already solved in the <span class='single-quote'>main</span> development branch.
</p><p>I made sure to test with all supported Python versions <span class='single-quote'>3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13</span> and in both Linux and macOS.
</p><p>The problem was only present in 3.12 and 3.13, after subinterpreters with separate GIL was introduced.
</p><p>
</p><h2>The community is awesome
</h2><p>
</p><p>In less than 1 hour and a half of posting the issue I got a response from a member of the Python Triage Team: "Bisected to <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/de64e7561680fdc5358001e9488091e75d4174a3'>de64e75</a>".
</p><p>I thought to myself: "that is awesome, this is happening so fast!".
</p><p>Then others pointed out that you could reproduce it with a shorter script:
</p><pre class="triple-quote python">import _xxsubinterpreters as interpreters

script = """print(int.__str__)"""


exec(script)
# Output: &lt;slot wrapper '__str__' of 'object' objects&gt;

interp_id = interpreters.create()
interpreters.run_string(interp_id, script)
# Output: &lt;slot wrapper '__str__' of 'int' objects&gt;
</pre><p>
</p><p>Having the exact commit where this problem was introduced and a concise way of seeing what the underlying problem is, I decided to give try to fix the issue myself. Diving into the CPython codebase.
</p><h2>Diving into CPython
</h2><p>
</p><p>The commit where the problem was introduced <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/de64e7561680fdc5358001e9488091e75d4174a3'>de64e75</a> has 185 additions and 86 deletions, and changes only 5 files.
</p><p>If you take a look at it the most suspicious one is <span class='single-quote'>typeobject.c</span>, you can see that it's changing some behavior in the MRO: Method Resolution Order. Which is the way methods are "inherited" from one class to another in Python.
</p><p>I thought that was related because in the subinterpreter the <span class='single-quote'>int</span> class inherits the method
 <span class='single-quote'>__str__</span> instead of 
 <span class='single-quote'>__repr__</span>. That was not the real issue, but I was correct about the file where the problem was.
</p><p>Debugging was done in the good old fashioned way, adding print statements all over the place.
</p><p>With my printing mechanism I managed to find out that the function that creates those <span class='single-quote'>&lt;slot wrapper ...&gt;</span> objects is called
 <span class='single-quote'>type_ready()</span>.
</p><p>That slot wrapper is a function that calls code from a type-slot. For example the <span class='single-quote'>int</span> type defines a slot called 
<span class='single-quote'>tp_str</span>. That slot is a C function that knows how to convert the object into a string. That C function is wrapped into a Python function which is executed when you do 
<span class='single-quote'>str(5)</span>.
</p><p>I could see that <span class='single-quote'>type_ready()</span> was called the first time from the main interpreter, and the second time from a subinterpreter, but this time it added more stuff.
</p><p>One would expect that <span class='single-quote'>type_ready()</span> gives the same result wether executed from a subinterpreter or from the main interpreter. The builtin types (
    <span class='single-quote'>int</span>, 
    <span class='single-quote'>str</span>, 
    <span class='single-quote'>float</span>, 
    <span class='single-quote'>bool</span>, ...) should be the same in all cases.
</p><p>Another group of changes in the <span class='single-quote'>typeobject.c</span> file was a lot of functions that obtain attributes from a builtin type, for example 
<span class='single-quote'>lookup_tp_dict()</span>:
</p><pre class="triple-quote C">static inline PyObject *
lookup_tp_dict(PyTypeObject *self)
{
+   if (self->tp_flags &amp; _Py_TPFLAGS_STATIC_BUILTIN) {
+       PyInterpreterState *interp = _PyInterpreterState_GET();
+       static_builtin_state *state = _PyStaticType_GetState(interp, self);
+       assert(state != NULL);
+       return state->tp_dict;
+   }
    return self->tp_dict;
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>This function is obtaining the <span class='single-quote'>tp_dict</span> property from a type. Which is a dictionary that stores attributes/methods of the class.
</p><p>In this case the entire if-statement was added. If you take a closer look you can infer what's happening. Before we just obtained the value by doing <span class='single-quote'>self->tp_dict</span>. 
Now, if it's a builtin type, we read the value from the interpreter state <span class='single-quote'>state->tp_dict</span>.
</p><p>With this information I started to dig deeper to see if I could find the exact place where the extra attributes were being added.
</p><p>Taking <span class='single-quote'>int.__str__</span> as an example to see what was going on:
</p><p><ol>
<li> The <span class='single-quote'>type_ready()</span> function gets executed as part of the main interpreter initialization process.</li>
<li> The function starts "readying" the <span class='single-quote'>int</span> type: 
<span class='single-quote'>tp_dict</span> gets filled by 
<span class='single-quote'>type_ready_fill_dict()</span>, one of the thing this function does is lookup which slots are <em>not empty</em> and add them to the dict, for 
<span class='single-quote'>int</span> the 
<span class='single-quote'>tp_str</span> slot is empty.</li>
<li> After that, <span class='single-quote'>type_ready_inherit()</span> gets called, and copies the 
<span class='single-quote'>tp_str</span> slot from object to int.</li>
<li> The init process for the main interpreter finishes and we're ready to start with the second interpreter.</li>
<li> In this case, the <span class='single-quote'>tp_str</span> slot is not empty for 
<span class='single-quote'>int</span>, it was filled by step 3. So it gets added to the dict by 
<span class='single-quote'>type_ready_fill_dict()</span>.</li>
<li> The program continues and we see different behavior depending on which interpreter we run.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>The problem here is that inside <span class='single-quote'>type_ready()</span> we expect 
<span class='single-quote'>type_ready_fill_dict()</span> to be called before 
<span class='single-quote'>type_ready_inherit()</span>. Which is true for the main interpreter but not for the subinterpreter. Also, this is caused because all the slots in 
<span class='single-quote'>int</span> are shared except for 
<span class='single-quote'>tp_dict</span> which is stored in each interpreter.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Summary
</h3><p>
</p><p>To summarize the problem: <span class='single-quote'>type_ready()</span> didn't receive a "clean" type. It was receiving a type with slots partially filled.
</p><p>Some slots were filled because they were shared among interpreters, others like <span class='single-quote'>tp_dict</span> were not shared. That caused inconsistencies between executions of 
<span class='single-quote'>type_ready()</span>.
</p><p>
</p><h2>The solution?
</h2><p>
</p><p>Given my lack of experience working in the CPython codebase I decided that the simplest solution was to make a quick and dirty solution.
</p><p>My solution was to check if <span class='single-quote'>type_ready()</span> was being called from a subinterpreter and in that case cleanup the base type so it looked the same as in the main interpreter.
</p><p>It boils down to adding this function:
</p><pre class="triple-quote C">static int
fix_builtin_slot_wrappers(PyTypeObject *self, PyInterpreterState *interp)
{
    assert(self->tp_flags &amp; _Py_TPFLAGS_STATIC_BUILTIN);
    assert(!_Py_IsMainInterpreter(interp));

    // Getting subinterpreter state
    managed_static_type_state *state = _PyStaticType_GetState(interp, self);
    assert(state != NULL);

    // Getting main interpreter state
    PyInterpreterState *main_interp = _PyInterpreterState_Main();
    managed_static_type_state *main_state = _PyStaticType_GetState(main_interp, self);
    assert(main_state != NULL);

    // Check wich attributes the type has in subinterpreter and it doesn't have
    // in the main interpreter. Store them in keys_to_remove.
    int res = -1;
    PyObject* keys_to_remove = PyList_New(0);
    if (keys_to_remove == NULL) {
        goto finally;
    }
    Py_ssize_t i = 0;
    PyObject *key, *value;
    while (PyDict_Next(state->tp_dict, &amp;i, &amp;key, &amp;value)) {
        if (!PyDict_Contains(main_state->tp_dict, key)) {
            if (PyList_Append(keys_to_remove, key) &lt; 0) {
                goto finally;
            }
        }
    }

    // Go through keys_to_remove and remove those attributes from
    // the base type in the subinterpreter.
    Py_ssize_t list_size = PyList_Size(keys_to_remove);
    for (Py_ssize_t i = 0; i &lt; list_size; i++) {
        PyObject* key = PyList_GetItem(keys_to_remove, i);
        if (PyDict_DelItem(state->tp_dict, key) &lt; 0) {
            goto finally;
        }
    }

    res = 0;

finally:
    Py_XDECREF(keys_to_remove);
    return res;
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>Then at the end of <span class='single-quote'>type_ready()</span>, call that function for builtin types and only if we're in a subinterpreter:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="triple-quote C">    if (type->tp_flags &amp; _Py_TPFLAGS_STATIC_BUILTIN) {
        PyInterpreterState *interp = _PyInterpreterState_GET();
        if (!_Py_IsMainInterpreter(interp)) {
            if (fix_builtin_slot_wrappers(type, interp) < 0) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
    }
</pre><p>
</p><p>And that's it. That was my solution. And it worked like a charm.
</p><p>
</p><h2>The wait
</h2><p>
</p><p>After sending a <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/117660'>PR</a> with my proposed changes I waited for a couple months until I saw some real activity.
</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/ericsnowcurrently'>Eric Snow</a> is in charge of the subinterpreters implementations. He found a better more focused solution that was less fragile and took into account what would happen if the interpreter was reinitialized.
</p><p>In the end I decided to close my PR because Eric's pushed the real solution into a separate PR.
</p><p>I think it would have been cool to ship code to be included in all python interpreters around the world. But I'm happy my analysis helped solve the issue.
</p><p>In Python 3.12.5 the fix was released: <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.python.org/release/3.12.5/whatsnew/changelog.html#core-and-builtins'>https://docs.python.org/release/3.12.5/whatsnew/changelog.html#core-and-builtins</a>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Thanks!
</h2><p>
</p><p>I wanted to say thanks again to all Python contributors that helped get this solved. From my experience I felt welcome by the community and that they cared about the time and effort I put in.
</p><p>I would say it was a great experience that I hope to repeat. And my cheers go to the Python community for setting up such an easy to follow process.
