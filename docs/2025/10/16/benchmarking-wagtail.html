</p><h1>Benchmarking Wagtail CMS Across Python Versions
</h1><p>
</p><p><strong>Testing real-world performance across 8 different Python versions</strong>
</p><p><em>Published: October 16, 2025</em>
</p><p><img alt='' src='/assets/images/wagtail-benchmark/python_versions.png'/>
</p><h2>Introduction
</h2><p>
</p><p>I've been curious about how different Python versions perform in real-world web applications. Python keeps getting faster with each release, but I wanted to see how much of a difference it actually makes when running a real application under load.
</p><p>So I decided to benchmark <strong>Wagtail CMS</strong> a Django-based content management system, tested across 8 different Python versions. This is the first in what I hope will be a series of benchmarks testing different Python web applications.
</p><p>Here's what I tested:
</p><ul><li><strong>Python 3.10</strong> (our baseline)
</li><li><strong>Python 3.11</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Python 3.12</strong>
</li><li><strong>Python 3.13</strong>
</li><li><strong>Python 3.13t</strong> (free-threaded, GIL disabled)
</li><li><strong>Python 3.14</strong>
</li><li><strong>Python 3.14-tailcall</strong> (experimental tailcall optimization)
</li><li><strong>Python 3.14t</strong> (free-threaded, GIL disabled)
</li></ul><p>The results were pretty interesting! You can check out the full benchmark setup and results at <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/mliezun/python-web-benchmarks'>https://github.com/mliezun/python-web-benchmarks</a>.
</p><h2>How I Set Up the Tests
</h2><p>
</p><h3>The Setup
</h3><p>
</p><p>I wanted to keep things realistic, so I used:
</p><ul><li><strong>Wagtail CMS 6.3</strong> with Django 5.1.4 (a real production setup)
</li><li><strong>Gunicorn 21.2.0</strong> as the WSGI server
</li><li><strong>SQLite</strong> with actual content (15+ blog posts, multiple pages)
</li><li><strong>Apache Bench (ab)</strong> for load testing
</li><li><strong>Docker</strong> to keep everything isolated and reproducible
</li></ul><p>For the experimental Python versions, I used custom Docker images:
</p><ul><li><span class='single-quote'>ghcr.io/mliezun/python-web-benchmarks/python-freethreaded:3.14t-slim</span>
</li><li><span class='single-quote'>ghcr.io/mliezun/python-web-benchmarks/python-freethreaded:3.13t-slim</span>  
</li><li><span class='single-quote'>ghcr.io/mliezun/python-web-benchmarks/python-freethreaded:3.14-tailcall-slim</span>
</li></ul><h3>Test Scenarios
</h3><p>I ran three scenarios that you'd actually encounter in real usage:
</p><p>1. <strong>Homepage Load</strong>: Full page with navigation, sections, and dynamic content
</p><p>2. <strong>Admin Login</strong>: Authentication and admin interface access
</p><p>3. <strong>Blog Browsing</strong>: Listing and viewing blog posts
</p><p>Each scenario was tested with <strong>1, 5, 10, and 20 concurrent users</strong> to see how things scale.
</p><h3>What I Measured
</h3><ul><li><strong>Requests per Second (RPS)</strong>: How many requests we can handle
</li><li><strong>Response Time</strong>: Average, p50, p95, and p99 percentiles
</li><li><strong>CPU Usage</strong>: How hard the server was working
</li><li><strong>Memory Usage</strong>: RAM consumption during tests
</li></ul><h2>The Results
</h2><p>
</p><h3>Overall Throughput Performance
</h3><p>
</p><p><img alt='' src='/assets/images/wagtail-benchmark/rps_comparison.png'/>
</p><p>Here's how many requests per second each Python version can handle. Higher is better, obviously.
</p><h3>Response Time Analysis
</h3><p>
</p><p><img alt='' src='/assets/images/wagtail-benchmark/response_time_comparison.png'/>
</p><p>This shows how response times change as we add more concurrent users. Lower is better here.
</p><h3>Relative Performance Improvements
</h3><p>
</p><p><img alt='' src='/assets/images/wagtail-benchmark/performance_gains.png'/>
</p><p>This is probably the most interesting chart - it shows how much faster each version is compared to Python 3.10 (our baseline). Positive numbers mean it's faster.
</p><h3>Resource Utilization
</h3><p>
</p><p><img alt='' src='/assets/images/wagtail-benchmark/resource_usage.png'/>
</p><p>CPU and memory usage is important for capacity planning. You want good performance without burning through resources.
</p><h2>What I Found
</h2><p>
</p><h3>🏆 Python 3.11 is the Winner
</h3><p>
</p><p><strong>Python 3.11 came out on top</strong> with about 3.2% better performance than Python 3.10 on average. That might not sound like much, but when you're handling thousands of requests per day, it adds up.
</p><h3>The Big Picture
</h3><p>
</p><p>1. <strong>Experimental versions are interesting</strong>: Python 3.14t (free-threaded) shows some promising results for concurrent workloads, but I'd be careful about using it in production just yet.
</p><p>2. <strong>All versions scale well</strong>: Every version handled 20 concurrent users without breaking a sweat. The newer versions just do it slightly better.
</p><p>3. <strong>Memory usage is consistent</strong>: All versions used roughly the same amount of RAM (~300-360 MB), so upgrading won't cost you more in memory.
</p><p>4. <strong>Everything was stable</strong>: Zero errors across all tests. All versions are production-ready.
</p><h2>My Recommendations
</h2><p>
</p><h3>For Production
</h3><p>
</p><p><strong>Go with Python 3.11</strong> if you want the best performance. It's stable, fast, and has been around long enough that most packages support it well.
</p><p><strong>Python 3.12</strong> is also a solid choice if you want something newer but still conservative.
</p><p>I'd hold off on the experimental versions (3.14t, 3.14-tailcall) for production use until they're more mature.
</p><h3>If You're Upgrading
</h3><p>
</p><p>If you're currently on Python 3.10 or earlier, here's what I'd suggest:
</p><p><strong>Important note</strong>: Python 3.10 reaches end-of-life on <em></em>October 31, 2026** according to the <a target='_blank' href='https://devguide.python.org/versions/'>Python Developer's Guide</a>. After that date, it will only receive security fixes, so you'll want to plan your upgrade well before then.
</p><p>1. <strong>Test everything</strong>: Run your full test suite on the target version first
</p><p>2. <strong>Check your dependencies</strong>: Make sure all your packages support the new version
</p><p>3. <strong>Benchmark your specific app</strong>: My results are for Wagtail - your mileage may vary
</p><p>4. <strong>Deploy carefully</strong>: Use canary deployments or blue-green strategies
</p><p>The good news is that memory usage is pretty consistent across versions, so you won't need to resize your servers.
</p><h2>Wrapping Up
</h2><p>
</p><p>So what did I learn from all this testing?
</p><p><strong>Python version upgrades are worth it.</strong> You get measurable performance improvements without needing more resources. Python 3.11 is the sweet spot right now - fast, stable, and well-supported.
</p><p>The experimental versions are definitely interesting to watch. The free-threaded versions (3.13t, 3.14t) could be a game-changer for certain workloads, but I'd wait until they're more mature before using them in production.
</p><p>I'm planning to benchmark more Python web applications in the future - maybe Django REST Framework, FastAPI, or even some data processing workloads. If you have suggestions for what to test next, let me know!
