</p><h1>The Enduring Simplicity of C
</h1><p>
</p><p>I recently came across a video by Salvatore Sanfilippo, the creator of Redis, titled "Why I use C and not Rust". It made me stop and think about the constant push for newer, "safer" programming languages.
</p><p>Watch the video <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SLsH755XAA'>here</a>.
</p><p>The gist of his argument is that while C has well-known memory safety issues, the modern alternatives, particularly Rust, come with their own significant costs. This isn't just about nostalgia for an older language, it's a pragmatic choice based on a different set of values.
</p><p>His points really resonated with me:
</p><ul><li><strong>Safety has a complexity cost.</strong> Rust's main selling point is memory safety, but this safety net makes certain things, like a doubly linked list, much more complex to implement. Sanfilippo argues that he'd rather have the directness and simplicity of C and manage the risks with good practices and tools like Valgrind.
</li><li><strong>The curse of hyper-dependencies.</strong> He makes a point that C's lack of a built-in package manager is a feature, not a bug. In ecosystems like Rust or Node.js, it's incredibly easy to accumulate massive dependency trees for simple projects. C forces you to be more deliberate.
</li><li><strong>The need for speed.</strong> The feedback loop in programming is critical. Sanfilippo notes that C compiles in seconds (or fractions of a second), while Rust is known for "biblical" compilation times. He argues that waiting for the compiler kills productivity and flow.
</li><li><strong>AI understands C better.</strong> This was the most surprising insight. Because of C's simple semantics and the sheer volume of C code in the world, LLMs are currently much better at reasoning about and generating C code than Rust. In an age where AI is becoming a co-pilot, this is a huge practical advantage.
</li></ul><p>It's not about being against progress. It's a realization that the "new and safe" way isn't always the "better" way. In engineering we always face compromise and deciding which language to use is just one of those cases.
</p><p>Personally, I like both languages, I'm more fond of C because of its simplicity, but the Rust toolchain and community pushing it forward makes it really easy to start a project and get everything you need to start building.
</p><p>A systems level programmer like Salvatore might pick C because he has the need to build an object system perfectly tailored for his application. But I mostly spend time writing APIs and glue code in Python, I would pick up Rust when I'm in the need for a little extra speed because is easy to integrate with Python code thanks to PyO3.
