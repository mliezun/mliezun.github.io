</p><h1>Rick and Morty and the end of history
</h1><p>
</p><p>In Season 2 Episode 6 named "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" we see how Rick and Morty go inside Rick's microverse car battery.
</p><p><img alt='' src='/assets/images/rick-and-morty-end-of-history/S2e6_Microverse_Battery.webp'/>
</p><p>The gist of it is that there's a universe inside a battery and the people have to pull cranks to make power. Some of that power is used in their own planet, the rest is used for Rick's car.
</p><p>But then inside each universe there's a new scientist that develops the same technology. In total we get 3 levels of nestedness inside batteries throughout the episode.
</p><p>There's a particular joke in this episode that is repeated each time a new character learns about the people inside the battery being used to generate the power.
</p><p>The joke goes something like this: 
</p><p>> Morty: "You have a whole planet sitting around making power for you? That's slavery!"
</p><p>> Rick: "It's society, they work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power."
</p><p>> Morty: "That just sounds like slavery with extra steps."
</p><p>> Rick: "Oh-la-la! Someone's gonna get laid in college."
</p><p>Until recently I just took this joke at face-value, I interpreted it as Morty being progressive and caring about people, and that's why he would get laid in college.
</p><p>But I just recently got recommended this video on youtube:
</p><p><img alt='' src='/assets/images/rick-and-morty-end-of-history/youtube-video.png'/>
</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pG-8XLLaE0'>Watch video</a>
</p><h2>Francis Fukuyama and the end of history
</h2><p>
</p><p>The video explains how all others political ideologies have been defeated by liberalism. In modern times called neoliberalism.
</p><p>It basically goes on to explain how starting from the 80s the western world has shifted from thinking of people as workers to calling them consumers.
</p><p>And this is because we know see everything through an economic lense, we think how much a person is worth in terms of money, we want to go to school to get better jobs to make more money instead of to just learn.
</p><p>Consumerism is the perfection of slavery, because people are enslaved by money, but they have a sense of choice (car, school, house, etc.), they perceive themselves as free and have no reason to rebel.
</p><p>There's an <a target='_blank' href='https://pages.ucsd.edu/~bslantchev/courses/pdf/Fukuyama%20-%20End%20of%20History.pdf'>article published by Francis Fukuyama</a> where this is explained in more detail.
</p><p>It basically says that we have reached the end of history in terms of political ideology because we cannot escape liberalism. Is a system that within itself allows for contradiction and even then remains stable. Where individuals feel free and in control and have no reason to rebel.
</p><p>What is more surprising is that he cites Hegel and Kojève as people that had already realized this was in motion in 1806 and 1930 respectively.
</p><p>For me this was eye-opening, I had never been exposed to this ideas, at least in such clear and distilled form. Something inside me tells me this is true, we're at the end of history. I don't think this is good or bad, but a powerful realization that allows me to see the world through a different lens.
</p><h3>EDIT
</h3><p>
</p><p>After posting this originally I found another video from Noam Chomsky which reinforces the idea of liberal capitalism as a form of slavery.
</p><p><a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR1jzExZ9T0'>Watch video</a>
</p><p>He basically says that having a job is like surrendering yourself to a master that has control over you life even bigger than the state. As a "free" person in a liberal society you're free to have a job or starve to death. That job is basically a tyranny.
