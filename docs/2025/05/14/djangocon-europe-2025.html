</p><h1>DjangoCon Europe 2025
</h1><p>
</p><p>I attended DjangoCon Europe this year, it was my first software conference, I always wanted to go to one, but never took the time until this year. A great experience overall, the most rewarding thing was meeting so much wonderful people.
</p><p>I had sparking conversations with many individuals, and I have taken notes from those before the memories fade.
</p><p>But I worry that I may have forgotten already about some of those, because there were so many.
</p><p>You can see more about the event here: <a target='_blank' href='https://2025.djangocon.eu/'>https://2025.djangocon.eu/</a>
</p><p>I gave a lightning talk about caddy-snake. A lot of people were confused about the name, so I might change it.
</p><p>Here's the talk: <a target='_blank' href='https://mliezun.com/caddy-snake-djangocon-2025.pdf'>caddy-snake-djangocon-2025.pdf</a>.
</p><p>If anyone is thinking about joining the Django community, please don't hesitate and do it. The people are great.
</p><p>There's a program called <a target='_blank' href='https://djangonaut.space/'>Djangonaut Space</a> which welcomes newcomers. You can find your way there.
</p><p>There are also many <a target='_blank' href='https://django.social/'>Django Social</a> events that you can join.
</p><p>Cheers!
