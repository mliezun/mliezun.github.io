# DjangoCon Europe 2025

I attended DjangoCon Europe this year, it was my first software conference, I always wanted to go to one, but never took the time until this year. A great experience overall, the most rewarding thing was meeting so much wonderful people.

I had sparking conversations with many individuals, and I have taken notes from those before the memories fade.

But I worry that I may have forgotten already about some of those, because there were so many.

You can see more about the event here: [https://2025.djangocon.eu/](https://2025.djangocon.eu/)

I gave a lightning talk about caddy-snake. A lot of people were confused about the name, so I might change it.

Here's the talk: [caddy-snake-djangocon-2025.pdf](https://mliezun.github.io/caddy-snake-djangocon-2025.pdf).

If anyone is thinking about joining the Django community, please don't hesitate and do it. The people are great.

There's a program called [Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space/) which welcomes newcomers. You can find your way there.

There are also many [Django Social](https://django.social/) events that you can join.

Cheers!
