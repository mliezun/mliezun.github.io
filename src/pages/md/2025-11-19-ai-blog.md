# AI generated content in this blog

![Image of text saying AI and crossed in red](/assets/images/ai-generated-content/not-ai.png)

In the last year I increased the usage of LLM based tools for code generation.

They have been of great help to improving the CSS styles and adding support for Dark and Light mode.

The previous post: [Benchmarking Wagtail](https://mliezun.com/2025/10/16/benchmarking-wagtail) was almost completely generated by Cursor. I did review it and decided to publish it but something felt off.

Which led me to think about the purpose of this blog itself.

I started this blog with the intention of being a place for tinkering, for expressing myself and to be creative.

I don't want to use LLM tools to generate the content of my posts anymore, since I will not be really expressing myself.

I will still use them to modify some parts of the engine and probably still use them for CSS styles.

For the sake of the readers I introduced some new tags that let you know if the content of a post contains AI-generated text or is completely human written.
