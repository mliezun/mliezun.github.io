# Removing read time

For a long time I've had "Reading time: x minutes" at the top of all articles in my blog. I cannot recall why I choose to do this, I suppose I saw it in another place and decided to copy it without thinking the reason. Maybe there was a reason and I just forgot.

Now I'm making a statement and removing it.

Other sites put this "time advertisement" so users can know wether it's gonna be a long or short read and they can decide to stay and read the full thing or to bookmark the article for later.

I don't like that, I want to start reading and keep on going if I feel captivated without thinking about the time.

Sometimes I also feel bad if the estimation says 5 minutes and it takes my 20 to read it and understand it.

For me, when writing, there's also this insecurity of an article not being good enough if it doesn't reach a certain number of minutes.

I'm getting rid of all that and doing one of my favorite activities in programming: deleting code.
